Palmer Penguin Data Analysis & Dashboard

## Overview



This project explores the **Palmer Penguins dataset**, a popular dataset for exploring penguin morphology, ecology, and distribution. Using **Power BI**, we created an interactive dashboard to analyze penguin traits such as **bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass**, and to visualize relationships across **species, island, and sex**.

The goal of this project is to **gain insights into penguin morphology and ecological patterns** while practicing data visualization and dashboard creation in Power BI.


## Dataset

**Source:** [Palmer Penguins Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data/data)

* **Contents:**

  * `Species`: Penguin species (`Adelie`, `Chinstrap`, `Gentoo`)
  * `Island`: Island where the penguin was observed (`Torgersen`, `Biscoe`, `Dream`)
  * `Culmen Length (mm)`: Bill length
  * `Culmen Depth (mm)`: Bill depth
  * `Flipper Length (mm)`
  * `Body Mass (g)`
  * `Sex`


* **Rows:** ~333 penguin samples

## Project Goals

1. Explore **morphological differences between species**.
2. Identify **relationships between traits** like bill size, flipper length, and body mass.
3. Analyze **penguin distributions by island and sex**.
4. Build **interactive visuals in Power BI** to communicate insights.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the Power BI file (`.pbix`) in **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Explore the dashboard:

   * Hover over scatter plots to see individual penguin data.
   * Use slicers to filter by species, island, or sex.

4. Modify or extend visuals as needed for further analysis.

## Insights (Example Observations)

* **Adelie penguins** tend to have smaller bills and flippers than **Gentoo penguins**.
* **Body mass distributions** vary significantly between species and islands.
* Males generally have slightly larger bill depth than females.
* Flipper length and body mass are positively correlated across all species.
